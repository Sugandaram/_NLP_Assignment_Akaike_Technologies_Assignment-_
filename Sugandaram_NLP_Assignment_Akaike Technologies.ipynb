      "Enter the paragraph: It is useful to characterize learning problems according to the type of data they use. This is a great help when encountering new challenges, since quite often problems on similar data types can be solved with very similar techniques. For instance natural language processing and bioinformatics use very similar tools for strings of natural language text and for DNA sequences. Vectors constitute the most basic entity we might encounter in our work. For instance, a life insurance company might be interesting in obtaining the vector of variables (blood pressure, heart rate, height, weight, cholesterol level, smoker, gender) to infer the life expectancy of a potential customer. A farmer might be interested in determining the ripeness of fruit based on (size, weight, spectral data). An engineer might want to find dependencies in (voltage, current) pairs. Likewise one might want to represent documents by a vector of counts which describe the occurrence of words. The latter is commonly referred to as bag of words features\n",
